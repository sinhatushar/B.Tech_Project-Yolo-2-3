Paseo de la Reforma is a wide avenue that runs diagonally across the heart of Mexico City. It was designed by Ferdinand von Rosenzweig in the 1860s and modeled after the great boulevards of Europe, such as the Ringstrae in Vienna and the Champs-lyses in Paris. After the French intervention in Mexico overthrew the constitutional President Benito Jurez, the newly crowned Emperor Maximilian made his mark on the conquered city.  He commissioned a grand avenue linking the city center with his imperial residence, Chapultepec Castle, which was then on the southwestern edge of town.  The project was originally named Paseo de la Emperatriz ("Promenade of the Empress") in honor of Maximilian's consort and second cousin Empress Carlota.  After her return to Europe and Maximilian's subsequent execution, the restored Jurez government renamed the Paseo in honor of the Reform War.
It is now home to many of Mexico's tallest buildings such as the Torre Mayor and others in the Zona Rosa.  More modern extensions continue the avenue at an angle to the old Paseo.  To the northeast it continues toward Tlatelolco, where it changes its name near the Plaza de las Tres Culturas.  There it divides into Calzada de Guadalupe and Calzada de los Misterios that continue toward La Villa. Its western portion going west from Chapultepec Park passes south of Polanco on its way through the affluent neighborhood of Lomas de Chapultepec and then into Cuajimalpa and Santa Fe on the outskirts of the city, although when it reaches this point it is more a highway than a promenade.

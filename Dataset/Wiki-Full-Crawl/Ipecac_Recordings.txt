Ipecac Recordings is an independent record label based in California. It was founded on April 1, 1999 by Greg Werckman (ex-label manager of Alternative Tentacles, ex-lead singer of DUH, ex-employee of Mercury Records) and Mike Patton (Faith No More, ex-Mr. Bungle, Fantmas, Tomahawk, Peeping Tom and Mondo Cane) in Alameda, California.
Originally the label was created for the sole purpose of releasing the first Fantmas album. Since then, they have gone on to distribute other artists like Melvins, Isis, as well as several of Patton's other projects and collaborations.
The label is named after syrup of ipecac, an emetic, or vomit-inducing, medicine. Its slogan is "Ipecac RecordingsMaking People Sick Since 1999."

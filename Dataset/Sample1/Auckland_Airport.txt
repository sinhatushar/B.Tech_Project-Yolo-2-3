Auckland Airport (IATA: AKL, ICAO: NZAA) is the largest and busiest airport in New Zealand, with 19,387,627 (10,594,128 international and 8,793,499 domestic) passengers in the year ended October 2017. The airport is located near Mangere, a residential suburb, and Airport Oaks, a service hub suburb 21 kilometres (13 mi) south of the Auckland city centre. It is both a domestic and international hub for Air New Zealand, and as the New Zealand hub of Virgin Australia and Jetstar Airways.
The airport is one of New Zealands most important infrastructure assets, providing thousands of jobs for the region. It handled 71 per cent of New Zealand's international air passenger arrivals and departures in 2000. It is one of only two airports in New Zealand (the other being Christchurch) capable of handling Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 aircraft.
The airport is the fourth busiest in Australasia after Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane airports. Around 2008, the airport was rated in the top 3 worldwide for airports handling 515 million passengers annually. It was also voted the 12th best airport in the world in 2013 at the Skytrax World Airport Awards, as well as being the best airport in the Australia/Pacific region.It has a capacity of about 45 flight movements per hour, using a single runway that is fully Cat IIIb capable (at a reduced rate of movements).  In November 2007 work began on a new northern runway, to be built in several stages and to be used mainly by smaller aircraft, freeing up capacity on the main runway. The project was put on hold for at least 12 months in October 2009, however, and deferred for a further few years in August 2010 following consultation with airlines and a review of capacity management options. The timing of the recommencement of construction of the second runway will be demand driven relative to the capacity of the existing runway. The expected completion date for the second runway is now 2025.

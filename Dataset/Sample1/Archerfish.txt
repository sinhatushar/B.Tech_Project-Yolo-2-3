The archerfish (spinner fish or archer fish) form a monotypic family, Toxotidae, of fish known for their habit of preying on land-based insects and other small animals by shooting them down with water droplets from their specialized mouths.  The family is small, consisting of ten species in a single genus Toxotes.  Most species live in fresh water rivers, streams and pools, but two or three are euryhaline, inhabiting both fresh and brackish water habitats such as estuaries and mangroves. They can be found from India and Sri Lanka, through Southeast Asia, to Northern Australia and Melanesia.Archerfish or spinnerfish bodies are deep and laterally compressed, with the dorsal fin, and the profile a straight line from dorsal fin to mouth. The mouth is protractile, and the lower jaw juts out. Sizes are fairly small, typically up to about 1218 cm (57 in), but T. chatareus can reach 40 cm (16 in).Archerfish are popular for aquaria, but difficult to feed since they prefer live prey.

The Southern Netherlands, also called the Catholic Netherlands, was the part of the Low Countries largely controlled by Spain (15561714), later Austria (17141794), and occupied then annexed by France (17941815). The region also included a number of smaller states that were never ruled by Spain or Austria: the Prince-Bishopric of Lige, the Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy, the County of Bouillon, the County of Horne and the Princely Abbey of Thorn. The Southern Netherlands were part of the Holy Roman Empire until the whole area was annexed by Revolutionary France.
The Southern Netherlands comprised most of modern-day Belgium and Luxembourg, some parts of the Netherlands and Germany (the region of Upper-Gueldres, now divided between Germany and the modern Dutch Province of Limburg and in 1713 largely ceded to Prussia and the Bitburg area in Germany, then part of Luxembourg) as well as, until 1678, most of the present Nord-Pas-de-Calais region and the Longwy area in northern France.

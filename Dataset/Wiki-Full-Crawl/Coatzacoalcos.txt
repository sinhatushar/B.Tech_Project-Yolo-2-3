Coatzacoalcos (Spanish pronunciation: [ko.at.sa.ko.al.kos]) is a major port city in the southern part of the Mexican state of Veracruz, on the Coatzacoalcos River. Coatzacoalcos comes from a Nahuatl word meaning "Site of the Snake" or "Where the snake hides". The city serves as the municipal seat of the municipality of the same name.
In January 2018, a nationwide survey conducted in December 2017 by the Mexican government's statistics agency found that 93.6 percent of Coatzacoalquenses perceived their city as dangerous and unsafe. This number was the fourth highest in Mexico, behind Chilpancingo de los Bravo, Fresnillo, and Villahermosa.

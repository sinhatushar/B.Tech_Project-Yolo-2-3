Lawrence James Tierney (March 15, 1919  February 26, 2002) was an American actor. Tierney was known for his many screen portrayals of mobsters and tough guys, roles that mirrored his own frequent brushes with the law. In 2005, New York Times critic David Kehr observed that "the hulking Tierney was not so much an actor as a frightening force of nature".

# BTP1
Contains code for Yolo2 and Yolo3 used on text data to detect RDF triples in a sentence.

Project Summary:
• This project aims to design an embedding scheme for knowledge graphs using neural networks techniques.

• Used Word2Vec, ELMo and GloVe word embedding to convert text into 3D matrix and gave it as input to a modified YOLO algorithm to predict RDF triples in the sentence.

• The training set for the above algorithm was made by using OpenIE annotator of the Stanford CoreNLP software.

• Made a knowledge graph from predicted RDF triples to make a question-answering system from it.

## There are separate readme files with details in each of the folders. 

1. Dataset : Contains dataset used for training.

2. Python scripts : Important python scripts used for working with dataset.

3. Yolo2-text : Yolo2 for text data.

4. Yolo3-text : Yolo3 for text data.

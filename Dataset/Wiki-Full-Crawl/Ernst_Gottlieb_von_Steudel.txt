Ernst Gottlieb von Steudel (30 May 1783, Esslingen am Neckar  12 May 1856) was a German physician and an authority on grasses.
He was educated at the University of Tbingen, earning his medical doctorate in 1805. Shortly afterwards he settled into a medical practice in his hometown of Esslingen, where with Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Hochstetter (1787-1860), he organized Unio Itineraria. In 1826 he became chief state physician of the Kingdom of Wrttemberg.
The botanical genera Steudelago (Kuntze, 1891) and Steudelella (Honda, 1930) honor his name.
